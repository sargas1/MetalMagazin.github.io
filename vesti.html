          <h2>Sevendust’s Morgan Rose Will Release Debut Solo Album in November</h2>
          <p>Tucked away after the closing credits of Sevendust’s full production livestream concert tonight (Friday, October 23) was a special announcement: drummer Morgan Rose will be releasing his debut solo album, titled Controlled Chaos, in November.”.
          </p>
          <p> No other details, such as exact release date, the record label putting it out or other musicians who appear on the album are known. Rose previously collaborated on the side project Call Me No One with Sevendust bandmate Clint Lowery — releasing one album, Last Parade, in 2012 — but this will be his first true solo effort.  
          </p>
          <p>Tonight’s livestream was Sevendust’s only show of 2020 and coincided with the release of their new album, Blood & Stone, from which they played three songs, including their cover of Soundgarden’s “The Day I Tried to Live.” The setlist spanned their entire career, including three songs from Animosity, one from the Sonny Mayo era, a few from their first two records and a handful of newer cuts. It’ll be available for replay for the next 48 hours right here if you’d like to purchase and watch — we highly recommend it!</p>

          <h2>Hatebreed Release New Single “Instinctive (Slaughterlust)”</h2>
          <p>Hatebreed have debuted a new song and music video, “Instinctive (Slaughterlust).” It’s a hardcore song with a Slayer riff and a lot of lyrics about overcoming dark shit. So, basically, it’s a Hatebreed song. We’re more than twenty years into this band’s career. By now you’re either onboard, not onboard, or new here. I love it, but if you’ve never enjoyed Hatebreed before, this won’t convert you, move along, nothing to see here.</p>
          <p>As for the video, which was directed by Justin Reich: I’m such a dope that at first I was like, “Oh, this video shows Jamey Jasta wearing a mask, that’s really cool and a refreshing change of pace from the ignorant macho bullshit we’ve had to endure recently.” But it turns out Jasta is wearing a mask not because of the pandemic, but because he’s breaking in someplace to create a giant mural with spray paint</p>
          <p>So then I wondered if Jasta is really the one doing the spray-painting in the video or if they’re swapping him out in some shots for someone else (his face is pretty well concealed, after all). Jasta is already an impressive dude, but if he can do this on top of everthing else, I mean… phew!

            Finally, I’d just like to add, for the record, that “slaughterlust” is my new favorite made-up word. Bravo, Hatebreed.</p>
