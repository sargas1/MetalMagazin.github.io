          The site was founded in December 2006 by authors Ben Umanov and Matthew Goldenberg who use the pen names Vince Neilstein and Axl Rosenberg.
          In April 2009, MetalSucks was awarded Metal Hammer's Web of Death Award for "Best Reviews" for its "honest, insightful, unpretentious – and fun – reviews."
          On April 12, 2011, F.Y.E. released the MetalSucks Fan Pack, a CD compilation that included 20 bands and a T-shirt. The item was exclusive only to F.Y.E. stores.
          On August 15, 2011, MetalSucks announced The Metal Suckfest, a two-day music festival to take place in Manhattan on November 4 and November 5 of that same year. 
          Municipal Waste and Cynic were announced as headliners. If the inaugural festival is a success, there are plans to make it an annual event.

          In July 2016, MetalSucks featured a negative piece on black metal band Deströyer 666. In a Facebook post the site stated, 
          "Deströyer 666 frontman K.K. Warslut is a racist, and apparently doesn't mind being labeled one, as he calls his fans 
          'faggots' and 'pussies' at an NYC show earlier this week." The post linked to a page on their site where they expanded 
          on the moment and the history of K.K. Warslut in the metal community, stating "Earlier this week, we reported that K.K.
           Warslut, frontman of Australian black metallers Deströyer 666, has alarmingly racist, misogynistic and violent tendencies."
            In response, the band claimed they have received death threats, and published the personal information for Goldberg and Umanov.
           Sucks eventually deleted all negative articles about the band and apologized for the posts, citing their regret that the band had 
           received death threats because of the posts.
        </p>

          On May 18, 2011 founder Axl Rosenberg made the following comment when asked about the origin of his pen name. 
          "A lot of people think it's so we can do undercover investigative journalism and express our honest opinions 
          without fear or reprisal, but that's not true at all. It's just that if the father of a fourteen year old girl 
          you met at Avenged Sevenfold show is looking for you, and he thinks your name is 'Axl Rosenberg', it's going to 
          be a lot harder for him to track you down."
          Years later this remark began to generate controversy contradicting the progressive message Metalsucks was attempting 
          to get across in its modern form prompting Rosenberg to issue an apology
